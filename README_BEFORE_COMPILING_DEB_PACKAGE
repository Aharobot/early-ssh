If you would like to compile a .deb (Debian) package, please copy all the files
into a separate directory, remove ALL the .hg directories and this reminder.

Please don't forget to fix the permissions as the following on and under the
DEBIAN directory:

chmod 755 DEBIAN
chmod 644 DEBIAN/changelog
chmod 644 DEBIAN/conffiles
chmod 644 DEBIAN/control
chmod 644 DEBIAN/copyright
chmod 644 DEBIAN/files
chmod 644 DEBIAN/md5sums
chmod 755 DEBIAN/postinst


Update the md5sums file by the following:
md5sum usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/early_ssh \
    usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-top/early_ssh \
    etc/early-ssh/early-ssh.conf.dist > DEBIAN/md5sums


After this you can create your own debian package by issuing:
dpkg --build /path/to/your/directory /path/to/package.deb
